## 🚀 Features

* **Fully Asynchronous:** Built with `asyncio`, `Motor` (for MongoDB), and `AIOHTTP` to be extremely fast and non-blocking.
* **High-Performance Database:** Uses a single, indexed collection for files, and a modern schema for filters and users, allowing the bot to scale to millions of files without slowing down.
* **Auto Filter & Manual Filter**
* **IMDB Search & Info**
* **Advanced Admin Commands** (Ban, Broadcast, Stats, etc.)
* **Fast Inline Search**
* **Spell Check** (Finds movies even with typos)
* **Group Management** (Welcome, Admin Tools, Connections)
* **File Indexing** (Index all files from any channel)
